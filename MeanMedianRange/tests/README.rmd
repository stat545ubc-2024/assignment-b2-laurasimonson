# Mean, Median, Range
## Tests folder

The tests folder contains an R file to run the tests that were created to ensure the mean_median_range function in this package runs correctly. 
Within the tests folder there is another folder called testthat and within the testthat folder is another R file called test-mean_median_range.R. This R file contains the code to run the four tests designed to check that the function works properly and can handle NA values and non-numerical inputs appropriately.
